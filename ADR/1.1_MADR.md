# MADR

### What is ADR?

ADR (Architectural decision records) - Is a type of documentation for describing project architecture

### First ADR

Install ADR Manager extention for vs code

Use ```ctrl + shift + p``` hotkey. Find ```ADR Manager: Add new ADR``` option

### Basic mode

1. Write ADR title. Usually follow ```YYYY-MM-DD Title``` format

2. Quickly describe problem and context. Describe what you need and requirements.

Context and Problem Statement:
```md
We need a reliable relational database to store user and order information.  
The requirements are:  
- ACID compliance.  
- Scalability for a growing number of users.  
- Support for complex queries and indexing.
```

3. Add options to solve problem

Options:
```md
* SQLite
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
```

4. Write decision outcome. Describe pros, contras and resons, why you have chosen an option

Chosen option: "PostgreSQL", because:
```md
**Pros:**  
- Reliable and transactional support.  
- Large community and rich ecosystem of tools.  
- Support for complex queries and extensions.

**Cons:**  
- Team training required.  
- Additional overhead for administration.
```

Finish creating ADR. Now you are able to read generated .md file

### Professional mode

1. Write ADR title

2. Add Last Updated date4

3. Assign status 
    a. Proposed
    b. Accepted
    c. Rejected
    d. Suppressed

4. Add Deciders

```md
Decider name
```

5. Add Technical Story (Task or Backlog story)

```md
[BE]-12 Add relational database
```

6. Repeat step 2 from basic mode to describe context

7. Describe decision drivers 

Decision Drivers are the key factors influencing the choice.

Decision drivers 
```md
- Ensure data consistency across multiple services (reliability)  
- Handle high user load and large datasets (scalability)  
- Minimize learning curve and operational complexity (skills, maintenance)  
- Budget constraints (operational cost) 
```

8. Repeat step 3 form basic mode to describe options

9. Repeat step 4 from basic mode to describe decision outcome

Also add beacuse statement

Because:
```md
PostgreSQL ensures data consistency across multiple services (reliability)  
It can handle high user loads and complex queries (scalability)  
Team already has experience with PostgreSQL, reducing training and operational overhead (skills)  
SQLite cannot handle multi-user environments effectively  
MySQL lacks certain extensions and features required for our project (JSON, PostGIS)
```

10. Add links that influenced your decision
