# Verilog Syntax Guide for Beginners

## 1. Modules
Basic structure:
```verilog
module and_gate(
    input a,
    input b,
    output y
);
    assign y = a & b;
endmodule
```
- `.v` file contains module definition.
- Ports: `input`, `output`, `inout`.

---

## 2. Data Types
- `wire` — connection for combinational logic
- `reg` — variable storing value in `always` block

Example:
```verilog
wire y;
reg a, b;
```

---

## 3. Combinational Logic
- Use `assign` for simple logic
```verilog
assign y = a & b;
assign z = a | b;
```
- Operators: `&` AND, `|` OR, `~` NOT, `^` XOR

---

## 4. Sequential Logic
- Use `always` blocks for flip-flops and registers
```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d; // non-blocking assignment
end
```
- Blocking `=` vs non-blocking `<=` (Assignment is being processed after always block)

---

## 5. Testbench
- `initial` block for simulation
```verilog
initial begin
    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    #10 a = 1;
    #10 $finish;
end
```
- `$dumpfile("wave.vcd")` and `$dumpvars(0, module_name)` for waveform generation

---

## 6. Timescale and Delays
```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps
#10 a = 1; // wait 10 time units
```
- Defines simulation time unit and precision

---

## 7. Debugging Outputs
- `$display` — prints once
- `$monitor` — prints whenever signal changes
- `$finish` — ends simulation

---

## 8. Instantiating Modules
```verilog
and_gate uut (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .y(y)
);
```
- Creates instance `uut` of `and_gate`
- Connects ports using `.port(signal)` syntax

---

## Summary
- Start with modules and ports
- Use `wire` and `reg` correctly
- Combinational logic with `assign`
- Sequential logic with `always`
- Use testbench with `$monitor` and waveform generation
- Understand timescale and delays
- Instantiate modules hierarchically
