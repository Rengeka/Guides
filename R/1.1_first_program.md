# R Language

## What R is?
R is an primarily interpreted programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualization.

R is used for:

    1. Statistical Analysis (regression, clustering, hypothesis testing)

    2. Data Visualization (plots, charts, dashboards)

    3. Machine Learning

    4. Data Wrangling (cleaning and transforming data)

    5. Bioinformatics, Finance, and Social Science research

    6. Academic and Industry Research

## Why Use R?

    1. Open-source and free

    2. Extensive packages (e.g., ggplot2 for visualization, dplyr for data manipulation, caret for machine learning)

    3. Powerful for working with tabular data

    4. Strong community support and documentation

## Installation

1. [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for your platform (Do not forget to add it to PATH env variable if using Windows)

2. Install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or VSCode extentions

3. Open RStudio and click ```File > New File > R Script``` or manually create script.R if using VSCode

4. Write this code: 
```R
print("Hello, R World!")
```

5. Click run (RStudion) or open cmd and use following command:
```bash
Rscript script.R
```

You will see this result:
```bash
[1] "Hello, R World!"
```

Congratulation! You have successfully created your first R program
